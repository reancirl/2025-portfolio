            <div class="page-content">
                <p>Seven years into my career as a software engineer, I made a decision that surprised many of my colleagues: I was going to build my own businesses. Not just one, but multiple ventures spanning different industries - from a clothing brand to potentially opening a coffee shop.</p>

                <p>This journey began with <a href="https://pmna.store/" target="_blank">PMNA Store</a>, my personal brand and e-commerce venture. What started as a side project has become a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit that drives me beyond just writing code.</p>

                <h2>Why Step Beyond Tech?</h2>
                
                <p>As developers, we're problem solvers by nature. We see inefficiencies and think, "There has to be a better way." But after years of solving other people's problems through code, I realized I wanted to solve problems that were closer to my heart - problems I was passionate about.</p>

                <p>The clothing brand wasn't just about fashion; it was about creating something tangible that people could wear and feel good about. The coffee shop idea? It's about community, bringing people together in a space where ideas flow as freely as the coffee.</p>

                <h2>Lessons from PMNA Store</h2>

                <p>Building PMNA Store taught me that entrepreneurship is just another form of problem-solving, but with different constraints:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customer validation is like user testing</strong> - You need to constantly iterate based on feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing is like documentation</strong> - If people don't understand your value proposition, your product won't succeed</li>
                    <li><strong>Inventory management is like database optimization</strong> - Efficiency and accuracy are crucial</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer service is like debugging</strong> - You need patience and systematic problem-solving</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Technical Advantage</h2>

                <p>Being a developer gives me unique advantages as an entrepreneur:</p>

                <p><strong>I can build my own tools.</strong> Need a custom inventory system? I can code it. Want to integrate with specific APIs? No problem. This saves money and gives me complete control over my business operations.</p>

                <p><strong>I understand scalability.</strong> From day one, I think about how systems will handle growth. This mindset applies whether I'm architecting a web application or planning business operations.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm comfortable with iteration.</strong> In development, we constantly refactor and improve. The same applies to business - nothing is perfect on the first try, and that's okay.</p>

                <h2>Balancing Multiple Ventures</h2>

                <p>The question I get most often is: "How do you manage being a full-time developer while building businesses?"</p>

                <p>The answer is the same principle I use in coding: <strong>modular thinking</strong>. Each venture is like a separate module with its own responsibilities, but they all contribute to the larger system - my life and career.</p>

                <p>My development work funds my entrepreneurial experiments. My business ventures teach me about user experience, market dynamics, and customer psychology - knowledge that makes me a better developer.</p>

                <h2>Eastlone Cafe - From Dream to Reality</h2>

                <p>The coffee shop dream has become reality with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eastlonecafe" target="_blank">Eastlone Cafe</a> - a physical space where the digital and physical worlds meet. It's where developers, entrepreneurs, and creatives gather to work, collaborate, and build the next big thing.</p>

                <p>This venture has been incredibly challenging, combining my love for community building with my entrepreneurial drive and technical skills. As someone who's spent countless hours in coffee shops coding, I knew exactly what kind of environment I wanted to create - and now I'm building it.</p>

                <p>The technical side of me couldn't resist building custom solutions for the cafe. I've developed a comprehensive business management system at <a href="https://eastlone.pmna.store/" target="_blank">eastlone.pmna.store</a> that includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Point of Sale (POS) System</strong> - Custom-built for our specific needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Resource Management System (HRMS)</strong> - Managing staff schedules and payroll</li>
                    <li><strong>Inventory Management</strong> - Real-time tracking of supplies and ingredients</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</strong> - Building relationships with our community</li>
                    <li><strong>Future ERP Integration</strong> - Planning for comprehensive business management</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Running a physical business while maintaining my development career has been one of the most challenging endeavors I've undertaken. It requires a completely different skill set - from managing suppliers and staff to understanding food costs and customer service. But it's also been incredibly rewarding, teaching me about business operations that no amount of coding experience could provide.</p>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>

                <p>Each business venture teaches me something new about myself and about building things that matter. Whether it's optimizing the user experience on PMNA Store, planning the perfect coffee shop layout, or architecting scalable web applications for clients, it's all connected.</p>

                <p>The goal isn't to become the next tech billionaire or to abandon development entirely. It's about building a portfolio of experiences and ventures that fulfill different aspects of who I am - the problem solver, the creator, the community builder.</p>

                <p>To fellow developers considering entrepreneurship: your technical skills are incredibly valuable, but don't underestimate the importance of understanding your customers, validating your ideas, and being willing to pivot when necessary.</p>

                <p>The journey from developer to entrepreneur isn't about choosing one or the other - it's about expanding your definition of what it means to build something meaningful.</p>
